INFO:root:Session ID: 15dc40f9-7f47-4400-a4f5-b34d8b4a43e3, AI Response: Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by inflammation and narrowing of the airways, which can lead to difficulty breathing, wheezing, coughing, and chest tightness. It can be triggered by various factors, including allergens (such as pollen, dust mites, and pet dander), respiratory infections, exercise, cold air, smoke, and strong odors.

Symptoms can vary in intensity and may occur frequently or only during specific situations, such as during physical activity or at night. Asthma is often managed through a combination of medication, including inhalers (both rescue and maintenance types), and lifestyle changes to avoid triggers. 

It's important for individuals with asthma to work with healthcare professionals to develop an asthma action plan that outlines how to manage their condition and respond to worsening symptoms. Regular monitoring and adherence to treatment can help control asthma and improve quality of life.
